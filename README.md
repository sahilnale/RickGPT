# Rick Sanchez Chatbot

## Overview

This project aims to create a chatbot inspired by Rick Sanchez from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty." The chatbot is developed using the Transformers library and fine-tuning DialoGPT, a large-scale pretrained response generation model by Microsoft.

## Project Description

As a fan of both "Rick and Morty" and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the goal was to leverage NLP and machine learning to create a virtual Rick Sanchez chatbot. The chatbot can engage in conversations mimicking the style and personality of Rick Sanchez.

### Sample Conversation

**User**: Hey, Rick, make me a time machine  
**RickBot**: You're a monster!  
**User**: No, I just want to travel in time  
**RickBot**: To the past.  
**User**: Yes  
**RickBot**: No time machine, please.  
**User**: But I need it  
**RickBot**: You don't need it, Morty. Just do it.  
**User**: I want to see ancient Greece  
**RickBot**: Oh, geez.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rick-sanchez-chatbot.git
   cd rick-sanchez-chatbot
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows use `env\Scriptsctivate`
   ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run the notebook:**

   Open the Jupyter notebook `GPTRick.ipynb` and run the cells to fine-tune the model and interact with the RickBot.

2. **Chat with RickBot:**

   Once the model is fine-tuned, you can start a conversation with RickBot within the notebook.

## Key Concepts

### Transformers

Transformers are state-of-the-art models in NLP that use self-attention mechanisms to process input data efficiently. This project utilizes the Transformers library by Hugging Face to fine-tune the DialoGPT model.

### DialoGPT

DialoGPT is a large-scale pretrained response generation model by Microsoft, designed for generating conversational responses. It is fine-tuned on a large dataset of dialogues to generate human-like responses.
