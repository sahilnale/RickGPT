# Rick Sanchez Chatbot

## Overview

This project aims to create a chatbot inspired by Rick Sanchez from the popular TV show "Rick and Morty." The chatbot is developed using the Transformers library and fine-tuning DialoGPT, a large-scale pretrained response generation model by Microsoft.

## Project Description

As a fan of both "Rick and Morty" and Natural Language Processing (NLP), the goal was to leverage NLP and machine learning to create a virtual Rick Sanchez chatbot. The chatbot can engage in conversations mimicking the style and personality of Rick Sanchez.

### Sample Conversation

**User**: Hey, Rick, make me a time machine  
**RickBot**: You're a monster!  
**User**: No, I just want to travel in time  
**RickBot**: To the past.  
**User**: Yes  
**RickBot**: No time machine, please.  
**User**: But I need it  
**RickBot**: You don't need it, Morty. Just do it.  
**User**: I want to see ancient Greece  
**RickBot**: Oh, geez.
